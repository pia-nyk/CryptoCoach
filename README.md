# Deep Q-Learning based Portfolio Optimizer

Portfolio optimization on cryptocurrency prices using DQN Agent. 

<b> Why not use Markowitz frontier directly? </b> <br/>
Markowitz efficient frontier doesn't work in this case as the price returns don't follow Normal distribution, which is a crucial assumption in the Modern portfolio theory. This is practically verified. [Pls refer this jupyter notebook](Portfolio_optimization_efficient_frontier.ipynb)

<b> What does the agent do? </b> <br/>
The DQN agent is trained to predict the prices & hence the returns obtained on 3 actions - (selling, buying and holding) the crypto portfolio consisting of 15 stocks by assigning them appropriate weights dynamically.

<b> How is the efficiency of the agent's actions tested? </b> <br/>
The returns generated by the action sequence followed by the agent is compared with a baseline (returns in case equal weightage is given to all the stocks in the portfolio throughout).
